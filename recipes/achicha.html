        <li>3 cups achicha ede (cocoyam flakes)</li>
        <li>600g green leafy vegetables. You can either use Green amaranth, Nigerian pumpkin leaves (ugu) or Spinach</li>

        <li>Seasoning cubes</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Cooking Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>The next morning, rinse the achicha and remove from the water.</li>
        <li>Crush into pieces </li>
        <li>Wrap the crushed achicha ede with uma leaves, banana leaves or aluminium foil and cook in a pot with some water for 20 to 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>While that is cooking, rinse and chop the following ingredients: green amaranth or ugu or spinach, scent leaves, onions and peppers.</li>
        <li>When the achicha ede is very soft, remove from the pot and set aside.</li>
        <li>In another clean dry pot, pour the red palm oil and heat it up. When the oil is hot, fry the onions for 3 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add the ukpaka and pepper and fry for another 3 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add the chopped leafy vegetable and stir till it heats up. Please note that when using spinach you need to cook the spinach in a separate pot till the excess water come out, then add only the vegetables so you do not have a pool of water in the meal.</li>
