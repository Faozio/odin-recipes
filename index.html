        <p>Classic Nigerian food, just the way grandmas made them. Nigerian food is essential to Nigerian culture. It defines the Nigerian people.
        This is why wherever we find ourselves; we are ready to eat our food daily without being bored one bit. We prefer to eat Nigerian food in any country we find ourselves in.
        This is because we never feel fulfilled if we do not eat correct Naija food from homeland. The so called Oyibo food is not satisfying for an average Naija person! In Nigeria, eating out is becoming more common these days but usually people eat at home.
        This is why it is essential that we all know how to cook these meals, especially the female folk. And with Nigerian men increasingly getting closer to the kitchen, cooking Nigerian food is now for all.</p>
